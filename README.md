Excel to PowerPoint Table ConverterThis .NET project automates the process of converting large Excel datasets into PowerPoint presentations. It reads an Excel sheet, segments the data into configurable chunks, renders each chunk as a high-quality table image, and embeds those images into a watermark-free PowerPoint presentation.FeaturesDynamic Column Handling: Automatically calculates column widths based on the content to ensure the table looks professional.Configurable Pagination: Split rows into a specific number of rows per slide (default is 15).Auto-Scaling: Images are scaled proportionally to fit standard 16:9 PowerPoint slides without distortion.Watermark-Free: Uses the Open XML SDK to generate native .pptx files without the "Evaluation" watermarks found in premium libraries.Prerequisites.NET SDK: .NET 6.0, 7.0, or 8.0+.Excel File: A source .xlsx file (configured in Program.cs).Dependencies (NuGet Packages)To run this project, you need to install the following NuGet packages:# For reading Excel files
dotnet add package ClosedXML

# For image generation and drawing
dotnet add package SixLabors.ImageSharp
dotnet add package SixLabors.ImageSharp.Drawing

# For PowerPoint generation (Microsoft Open XML SDK)
dotnet add package DocumentFormat.OpenXml
How It WorksExtraction: The application uses ClosedXML to read all used cells from the first worksheet of the specified Excel file.Segmentation: Data is divided into "chunks" based on the RowsPerSlide constant.Rendering:Each chunk is processed by ImageSharp.The code measures the text of every cell to determine the required width for each column.It draws a table with a grey header background and black borders.PPTX Construction:A new PowerPoint document is initialized via the Open XML SDK.A basic Master/Layout structure is created to ensure the file is valid.Each table image is saved to a temporary path, embedded into a slide, and scaled/centered using English Metric Units (EMUs).ConfigurationIn Program.cs, you can modify the following constants:RowsPerSlide: Adjust how many data rows appear on one slide.ExcelPath: The full system path to your source data.OutputPptxPath: The destination where you want the presentation saved.UsagePlace your data in an Excel file named data.xlsx.Update the paths in Program.cs to match your local environment.Run the project:dotnet run
Find your generated presentation at the OutputPptxPath location.
